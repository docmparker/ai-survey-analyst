    "Here we demonstrate sentiment analysis on a group of student feedback comments. This involves classifying the comments as 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral'. We'll also show an even finer-grained sorting from most positive to most negative, along with some nice color-coded output. \n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the scenes, if you are interested, we're using the model's logprobs (what were its first, second, third, etc. choices for the sentiment output token, and how confident was it in each of those possible choices) to get a sense of how confident the model was in its prediction and what else it considered. gpt-4 (post-RLHF, what we have access to) is somewhat well calibrated (it knows what it knows...kind of like metacognition for a model) and using the logprobs relies on this type of confidence."

      "Student comment: \"I give the course a 2-2.5. I've graduated with a Bachelor's in Finance and wanted to try a coursera course to expand, or reaffirm, my knowledge of various topics. I did relearn a handful of concepts and learn more about other topics. But, it makes more sense as an intro class. As others were saying, I guess the course is taken from a full course, so the videos are snippets and do not provide a full understanding of all the topics.The slides can be put together better (too wordy and/or provide a reference guide on what was covered in the entire lecture). I had the videos on 1.5x-2.0x speed as the prof spoke slow so I can see why people were annoyed by that. If anyone has taken a course on Investopedia, they do it better. They provide exercises frequently, notes, and make the content engaging and easy to follow. Maybe check out Investopedia for a small range of courses.But to answer who this is for.. Someone just starting in Finance. If you had years of Financial markets in college, you do not need this. Or if you take it for free, look at the various videos and watch those as there are some informative videos on areas I haven't learned in college. But overall, not really engaging, kind of thrown together, no resources/notes just slides and closed captions as text. Would be better if topics were broken down, slides were more appealing, notes/guides provided, and different exercises throughout each lecture (the aggregate of all the individual videos).\"\n",

Just watching the first few videos seems like you are pushing some type of personal ideology or agenda.  Though it may have good intentions, I personally would rather a course without alluding to your views of morality and how everyone should give away their money.On the contrary, I would argue that if wealth is created / preserved/ grown And kept within a family for many generations rather than fully donated to philanthropy, that family will likely not just sit on it under a mattress but it will \"circulate\" through the economy again anyway.  For example, if a family wealth portfolio is kept or managed at any one of the big banks or investment houses, it is essentially recirculating since it is not in a box but getting re-invested and so on.  Essentially just numbers in a spreadsheet at that point.. but numbers that may end up financing a poor family's mortgage, business loan, and of course the tax revenue to the state via tax on capital gains and dividends.Best regards.\"\n",

Having paid for this course I would also have expected some manuscripts or at least a copy of the (rather unusable) slides.However the course gives a broad overview of financial topics and probably also mentions most of the concepts of key words. Unfortunately, Prof. Shiller fails to give adequate and precise definitions most of the time. They could have been included in the slides to help the students to learn in a more strucured manner. Probably the best thing about the course (for me) was that he recommended to read Nassim Taleb's works, which I did, and his books (in combination with reading up on definitions on wikipedia) really offer a lot more understanding than this course.I would recommended to consult anyone to consult a standard text-book on finance and the works of Nassim Taleb to spice things up, rather than to take this course.\"\n",

Lectures don't follow a logical thread and are put in a confused order. Quizzes have even some questions completely unrelated to the material of the previous lectures. I think Yale should provide better courses. Moreover, it's quite old (2016) so it's not updated to current events. \"\n",

The online course is based on snippets taken from face-to-face lectures and breakout sessions, and the result is utter incoherence. The instructor frequently refers to concepts that have not yet been encountered in the online version of the course; makes extensive use of mathematical notations and formulas whose variables are never properly explained; and generally does a poor job of explaining the material. This online version of the Yale course was obviously slapped together with very little thought and production value; it's one of those unsuccessful attempts to bring in revenue on the cheap, creating an online version out of existing face-to-face material, rather than building a real online course from scratch. This was wasted money and time. This attempt to capitalize on the Yale brand is pathetic.    \"\n",

However, the course content focused way too much on history and very little practical use. There are some videos where the lesson gets cuts over to the students having a conversation with he lecturer. That does not seemed to be a very smooth transition.\"</span><br><span style=\"color:LightSalmon; font-size:1.2em\">\"Good content but Presentation is quite rambling\"</span><br><span style=\"color:LightSalmon; font-size:1.2em\">\"Not relevant with name.\"</span><br><span style=\"color:LightSalmon; font-size:1.2em\">\"Only US oriented \"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"there is no translate to Arabic \"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"I give the course a 2-2.5. I've graduated with a Bachelor's in Finance and wanted to try a coursera course to expand, or reaffirm, my knowledge of various topics. I did relearn a handful of concepts and learn more about other topics. But, it makes more sense as an intro class. As others were saying, I guess the course is taken from a full course, so the videos are snippets and do not provide a full understanding of all the topics.The slides can be put together better (too wordy and/or provide a reference guide on what was covered in the entire lecture). I had the videos on 1.5x-2.0x speed as the prof spoke slow so I can see why people were annoyed by that. If anyone has taken a course on Investopedia, they do it better. They provide exercises frequently, notes, and make the content engaging and easy to follow. Maybe check out Investopedia for a small range of courses.But to answer who this is for.. Someone just starting in Finance. If you had years of Financial markets in college, you do not need this. Or if you take it for free, look at the various videos and watch those as there are some informative videos on areas I haven't learned in college. But overall, not really engaging, kind of thrown together, no resources/notes just slides and closed captions as text. Would be better if topics were broken down, slides were more appealing, notes/guides provided, and different exercises throughout each lecture (the aggregate of all the individual videos).\"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"I prefer a course that teaches the fundamentals of financial markets in an Objective manner.  Just watching the first few videos seems like you are pushing some type of personal ideology or agenda.  Though it may have good intentions, I personally would rather a course without alluding to your views of morality and how everyone should give away their money.On the contrary, I would argue that if wealth is created / preserved/ grown And kept within a family for many generations rather than fully donated to philanthropy, that family will likely not just sit on it under a mattress but it will \"circulate\" through the economy again anyway.  For example, if a family wealth portfolio is kept or managed at any one of the big banks or investment houses, it is essentially recirculating since it is not in a box but getting re-invested and so on.  Essentially just numbers in a spreadsheet at that point.. but numbers that may end up financing a poor family's mortgage, business loan, and of course the tax revenue to the state via tax on capital gains and dividends.Best regards.\"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"I have paid amount but the certificate was not got can please respond fast.\"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"I didn't get any certificate after my court were completed.i complete 2 of the courses in Coursera but I didn't receive any certificate \"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"As per my opinion this is course is not much effective\"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"To many discussions... not really a financial course\"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"This course doesn't provide the fundamental element and the basis of financial markets. It is a collection of novels about financial markets and istitution\"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"By all my due respect, it was hard to follow the instructor. The vital and important pieces of information were lost during the lectures due to confused and spontaneously mixed speeches. The lectures was not constructed properly to go from stating a theory, then presenting arguments and then coming to a conclusion.Nevertheless, I completed this course with a higher grade thanks to my previous university education.Sorry, if I may seem to be tough.\"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"I can't access the quiz 5 and beyond.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.Kerry McGovern\"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"Useless\"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"It was not very interesting. The course needs to be more self-explanatory, with real world examples, and not dull\"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"Professor seems to skip a lot of essential information and he is pretty hard to follow. Definitely an academic and not a instructor.\"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"very tough to understand ...use simple language to explain\"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"Poorly produced. \"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"The videos are part of a real university course but are only snippets of lectures. The arrangement is bad. The instructor is very knowledgeable but often hard to follow. I reached week four but dropped out. I have learned quite a lot but I don’t think my knowledge is going to stay for long because I only understand small  individual parts of lessons enough to pass the normal quizzes and have a ~50% on the honors quiz... Everything is quite a mess. :(Professor Shiller has won a Nobel prize and I look up to him for that, but this course was just not planned well at all.\"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"The guy can't teach\"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"very bad\"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"Cuts up lectures and feels very disjointed, bounces from concept too concept too quickly. \"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"very confusing and doesn't seem connected or flow\"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"Though the course is provided by one of the most esteemed university and professor, the \"Beginner Level\" tag on the course is highly misleading. I wanted a systematic introduction to financial linguistic and subsequent up-gradation of difficulty level, but what I experienced was a highly intellectualized lecture from the very beginning.This course is best suited for individuals who have a prior knowledge and understanding of the subject, otherwise the entire lecture will sound alien and unorganized to the beginners.I urge the Yale management to revise the misleading \"Beginner Level\" in this course. \"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"NOT INTERESTING.COURSE CONTENTS AND NAME OF THE COURSE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT. CONTENTS ARE TOO WIDE.\"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"I was expecting more from the course. It is very unstrucuted and even misses a complete table of contents. Having paid for this course I would also have expected some manuscripts or at least a copy of the (rather unusable) slides.However the course gives a broad overview of financial topics and probably also mentions most of the concepts of key words. Unfortunately, Prof. Shiller fails to give adequate and precise definitions most of the time. They could have been included in the slides to help the students to learn in a more strucured manner. Probably the best thing about the course (for me) was that he recommended to read Nassim Taleb's works, which I did, and his books (in combination with reading up on definitions on wikipedia) really offer a lot more understanding than this course.I would recommended to consult anyone to consult a standard text-book on finance and the works of Nassim Taleb to spice things up, rather than to take this course.\"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"Mr. Shiller is a nice professor, but this course has many flaws so I did not complete it. First of all, it's almost entirely focused on the U.S. situation, so it's not really suitable for worldwide users.Then, it's quite disorganized. Lectures don't follow a logical thread and are put in a confused order. Quizzes have even some questions completely unrelated to the material of the previous lectures. I think Yale should provide better courses. Moreover, it's quite old (2016) so it's not updated to current events. \"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"the pace is extremely monotonous and it makes the course really mundane. i want to drop this one and take another one instead, but i just cant!\"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"As it was highlighted as free course with certification for MOOC.I haven't received course completion certificate though my course has been fully completed. This issue needs to be addressed as why Coursera is not issuing course completion certification as promised  during COVID 19..Such a cheating to all the candidate to enroll for any course.This is not acceptable at all.\"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"Honestly, this course could have been a lot better but it was very vaguely put together. Definitely not an introductory course.The structure was pretty much all over the place.I later enrolled in for ISBs course on financial markets and it yielded way better results for me.STRUCTURE BAD. CONCEPTS RANDOM. TOPICS NOT ADDRESSED IN DETAIL.\"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"This was a terrible course. \"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"waste of time, I could not understand properly the concepts, as he is not going straight to the point. so I unenrolled after watching few videos\"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"I am shocked that the course gets such high reviews. This is my third course with Coursera, but I don't think I will finish it (the other two I completed and gave five stars). The instructor often fails to introduce new or challenging concepts. When he does so he fails to explain them with the care and precision necessary for the learner to operationalize the idea. For a beginner course, this one really misses the mark. My sibling was also taking the course and we agreed on the course's shortcomings. It's a shame, because Professor Shiller obviously has a lot of knowledge.\"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"Not at all legitimate course. The concepts and principles of the course, instructor are not clear. I'm a stock market trader and in one of his quiz the answer of one his question was stop loss at 50% value down. According to this very soon you will find yourself at the footpark. More over he's find out to be staying in the history all the time.\"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"This couse seems to completely deviate from the main topic. it should include how to read the financial market closely, technical part of it like changes, how to assess multiple companies and track there movement. Instead of giving some stories of the Amercan area. I am deeply disappointed and it is not at all up to my expectation. The previous course that i did was remararkably informative and relevant.How to I unenroll without wasting my money! Please help.thank You!\"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"too short videos\"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"This course is virtually worthless. I couldn't follow the lectures, and I have a PhD and have been a tenured professor for almost two decades. The online course is based on snippets taken from face-to-face lectures and breakout sessions, and the result is utter incoherence. The instructor frequently refers to concepts that have not yet been encountered in the online version of the course; makes extensive use of mathematical notations and formulas whose variables are never properly explained; and generally does a poor job of explaining the material. This online version of the Yale course was obviously slapped together with very little thought and production value; it's one of those unsuccessful attempts to bring in revenue on the cheap, creating an online version out of existing face-to-face material, rather than building a real online course from scratch. This was wasted money and time. This attempt to capitalize on the Yale brand is pathetic.    \"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"I find the professor is hard to understand because he is so slow in making a point.  I have listened to a few lectures and have given up.  I am going to look for another course.\"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"Don't waste your time! It's unstructured pile of videos recorded from face-to-face teaching. No explanations, no order, no structure, nothing.\"</span><br><span style=\"color:Red; font-size:1.2em\">\"Lots of content seems to be cut out from the original lectures. There are cases where the questions in a certain quiz are related to lessons a few weeks in the future.
